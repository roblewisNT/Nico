About: 

Through honest materials, a desire for simplicity and lasting craftsmanship, Simon James celebrates the spaces we spend time in. Through the showroom, retail store and online store, our own designs are shared alongside the work of others.
<br><br>
Furniture and lighting are accompanied by an evolving edit of clothing, modern artefacts and home goods that go beyond what is necessary. All share common ground in their ability to combine beauty with function, and ritual with basic need.
